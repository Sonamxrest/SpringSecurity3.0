Websocket is a protocol designed to overcome architecture limitation.
Bi-directional communication between server and client.
Works over TCP protocol.
STOMP is sub-protocol working over web sockets.
Stomp is one such sub protocol that can work over Websocket to exchange message between clients.

STOMP is a messaging protocol because clients can produce messages
(send messages to a broker destination) and consume them
(subscribe to and receive messages from a broker destination).

@SubscribeMapping is used for one time sending message to clients.
The @MessageMapping annotation is used for repetitive messaging from application to clients.

In the following example, the method annotated with the @MessageMapping and @SendTo annotations
with the String return type receives a SEND frame from a client to the /app/request destination,
performs some action, and sends a MESSAGE frame to the explicit /queue/responses destination.

@Controller
public class MessageMappingController {
   @MessageMapping("/request")
   @SendTo("/queue/responses")
   public String handleMessageWithExplicitResponse(String message) {
       logger.info("Message with response: {}", message);
       return "response to " + HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(message);
   }
}
